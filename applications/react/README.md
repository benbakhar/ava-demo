# Getting Started with Ava React Sample

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Demo
First, head over to `App.tsx` files and replace the following placeholders with your respective values:

```typescript
const token = "YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE";
const accountId = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_GOES_HERE";
const longRegionCode = "YOUR_REGION_CODE_GOES_HERE";
const videoName = "YOUR_VIDEO_NAME_GOES_HERE";
```

Then, from the root folder run the following to start the Demo Application:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
